        The IESS Sanitizer™ uses patented technology to deep clean your medical
        equipment.{" "}

      <br />
      <p>
        Recently, the IESS Sanitizer™ was put to the test. Testing performed by
        an independent laboratory confirmed the value of the IESS Sanitizer™ as
        part of your cleaning and infection control protocol.

        At a nursing home facility, five wheelchairs were selected at random.
        Using appropriate swab testing procedures, the five wheelchairs were
        tested before being cleaned and after being washed and disinfected using
        the IESS Sanitizer™.{" "}
      </p>
      <br />{" "}
      <p>
        Before being cleaned, three of the five wheelchairs had bacteria at
        "EXCESSIVE GROWTH" levels, resulting in a strong recommendation to
        "Review Disinfecting Procedures".{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        {" "}
        All five of the wheelchairs were then cleaned and disinfected using the
        IESS Sanitizer™ machine.{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        {" "}
        After washing and disinfecting the wheelchairs using the IESS
        Sanitizer™, the test results concluded that all five wheelchairs had "NO
        GROWTH" and that "Disinfection Practices are Excellent"!{" "}
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        {" "}
        This independent testing confirmed two facts: one, the obvious need to
        properly clean and disinfect medical equipment, such as wheelchairs; and
        two, the effectiveness of the IESS Sanitizer™ in doing the job.{" "}
