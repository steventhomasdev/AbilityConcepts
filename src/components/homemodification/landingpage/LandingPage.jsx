                When caring for a person with limited mobility, many issues need
                to be addressed, including those involving home modifications.
                Most older people live in homes that are more than 20 years old.
                As these buildings get older, they become more difficult to live
                in. A house that was perfectly suitable for a person at age 55
                may have too many stairs or slippery surfaces for the same
                person at age 70 or 80.

                One in three Canadians over the age of 65 will experience a fall
                within their homes this year. Research shows that home
                modifications and repairs may prevent 30% to 50% of all home
                accidents among seniors. We understand the importance of an
                accessible home. Our goal is to understand the clientâ€™s current
                and future needs, in order to create practical and aesthetically
                pleasing solutions and to help complete the project in a manner
                that best addresses the unique situation. Please call us for
                information specific to your home and situation.
