        restoring movement and making a difference in the lives of thousands of
        patients we serve. By launching our personalized productions and plans,
        we are proud to provide innovative medical technologies and surgical
        planning for a variety of body part replacement and implants. We are
        focusing on designing bio-materials based on advanced approaches such as
        ceramic bone void fillers, elastic composites, cell-based therapies and
        bio-absorbable polymer implants. This process covers pre-clinical
        testing and regulatory submissions. In this project, Ability Concepts is
        co-funding prototyping of implantable scaffolds for bone regeneration
        and sustained medication in the University of Waterloo. The project is
        co-funded with Mitacs, one of the largest non-profit national research
        organizations. Mitacs, in partnership with Canadian academia, private
        industry and government, operates research and training programs in
